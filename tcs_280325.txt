== what is bad file,discard file?

bad file- contains records not loaded due to errors like syntactical erros,
data type mismatch,constraint violations,missing required fields
discard file-  records those are intentionnaly skipped based on filter conditions
i.e when condition fails.

load data infile 'emp.csv' badfile 'emp.bad' discard 'emp.dis' into table emp
fields terminated by ',' trailing nullcols when dept_no='10' 
( empid,emp_name,dept_no,sal)

== what is bulk collect

it will collect the multiple rows from select statement and will place into collection variable in a single operation.
it will reduces the no.of context switches b/w sql engine and plsql engine.

ex:

DECLARE
    TYPE emp_table IS TABLE OF employees%ROWTYPE;
    emp_data emp_table;  -- Collection to store multiple rows
BEGIN
    SELECT * BULK COLLECT INTO emp_data FROM employees WHERE salary > 5000;

    -- Print results
    FOR i IN 1..emp_data.COUNT LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(emp_data(i).emp_id || ' - ' || emp_data(i).emp_name);
    END LOOP;
END;
/



== what is forall
it is bulkDML feature in plsql, when we perform dml operations on bulk data.
it will reduces the no.of context switches b/w plsql engine and sql engine.

DECLARE
    TYPE emp_ids IS TABLE OF employees.emp_id%TYPE;
    emp_list emp_ids := emp_ids(101, 102, 103);  -- List of employees to update
BEGIN
    -- Bulk update salaries
    FORALL i IN 1..emp_list.COUNT
        UPDATE employees
        SET salary = salary * 1.10  -- Increase salary by 10%
        WHERE emp_id = emp_list(i);

    COMMIT;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Salaries Updated in Bulk');
END;
/



== what is for update
If we write for update along with cursor select statement exclusively row level lock will 
be applied for all the rows which are identified by that cursor select statement. Until we give 
commit no one cannot be modify those rows. 


== what is where current of
Generally we cannot perform DML operations when we using cursor for update in our 
program if we want to perform DML operations on which are locked by the cursor for update the 
we should go for the “where current of”. 

Ex: 
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE SP_FOR_UPDATE 
AS 
CURSOR C1 IS SELECT * FROM EMP FOR UPDATE; 
VEC EMP%ROWTYPE; 
BEGIN 
OPEN C1; 
LOOP 
FETCH C1 INTO VEC; 
EXIT WHEN C1%NOTFOUND; 
UPDATE EMP SET COMM=SAL*10/100 WHERE CURRENT OF C1; 
END LOOP; 
CLOSE C1;
END;


== what is bfile
In Oracle SQL, BFILE (Binary File) is a data type used to store large binary objects (LOBs) that reside outside the database in the operating system file system. 
Unlike BLOB, which is stored inside the database, a BFILE is only a pointer (a reference) to an external file.

CREATE OR REPLACE DIRECTORY my_bfile_dir AS '/path/to/external/files';
GRANT READ ON DIRECTORY my_bfile_dir TO some_user;


CREATE TABLE my_table (
    id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    file_data BFILE
);

INSERT INTO my_table (id, file_data) 
VALUES (1, BFILENAME('MY_BFILE_DIR', 'example.pdf'));

When you need read-only access to external files.
When you need to store large binary files (like images, PDFs, videos) but do not want to store them inside the database.

== what is dbms_profile

DBMS_PROFILER is a predefined package.It is useful know the performance our program taking even it is procedure (or) function. It is used 
get information like how many times each statement is executing how much time it is taken to execute 
that statement.

for this we need one view i.e all_source, PLSQL_PROFILER_DATA table


 BEGIN 
DBMS_PROFILER.start_profiler('SP_DATA_LOADINNG'); 
SP_DATA_LOADINNG; 
DBMS_PROFILER.stop_profiler; 
END; 

 Here  
 start_profiler, stop_profiler are packaged procedures in the 
“DBMS_PROFILER” package.
 
 SP_DATA_LOADINNG is a individual profiler which is we want to know the run time. 

 After executing this then we want to check the result then we want to result we should go for that 
two tables join like: 

Ex: SELECT A.TEXT, A.line, P.TOTAL_OCCUR, P.TOTAL_TIME/1000  
FROM ALL_SOURCE A, PLSQL_PROFILER_DATA P  
WHERE A.line=P.LINE
AND A.name='SP_DATA_LOADINNG'; 


== what are the collection datatypes 
nested table
varray
plsql table or associative array



2nd interviewr questions

== what is blob

In Oracle SQL, BLOB (Binary Large Object) is a data type used to store large binary data inside the database. 

Stores Large Binary Data: Used for storing images, videos, PDFs, audio files, etc.
Stored in the Database: Unlike BFILE, which is a pointer to an external file, BLOBs are stored inside the database.
Supports Read & Write Operations: Unlike BFILE (which is read-only), BLOB data can be modified.
Supports Transactions: Since it is stored in the database, BLOBs are covered by Oracle’s ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

Maximum Size: Up to 128 TB (depends on block size and storage configuration).

When to Use BLOB vs. BFILE?
Feature	                 BLOB	                                     BFILE
Storage	             inside the database	                     Outside the database
Read/Write	     Supports both	                             Read-only
Transaction Support	Yes	                                     No
Maximum Size	       128 TB	                                     4 GB (OS Limit)
Backup & Recovery    Managed by Oracle	                             Handled externally
Performance	    Slightly slower for large files	             Faster for reading large files

Use BLOB when:
✅ You need full database control (transactions, backups, security).
✅ You need to modify the binary data.

Use BFILE when:
✅ Files are too large and should remain outside the database.
✅ The data is read-only and does not need transactional consistency.

== what is the diff b/w varchar and varchar2


Feature	                         VARCHAR	                                                             VARCHAR2
Definition	             ANSI standard data type (not fully supported in Oracle)	               Oracle-specific data type
Usage in Oracle	             Allowed for compatibility but behaves like VARCHAR2	               Fully supported and recommended for use
Storage	                     May store extra space for future expansion (behavior is uncertain)	       Stores only the actual data (no extra space)
Behaviorin Comparisons	     May treat empty strings as NULL in some implementations	               Treats empty strings as NULL in Oracle
Future Support	             Deprecated (may be removed in future versions)	                       Actively supported


== what is bitmap index

A Bitmap Index is a special type of index in Oracle that uses bitmaps (arrays of bits) to efficiently store and retrieve data, 
especially for columns with low cardinality (i.e., few distinct values). 
Instead of storing row IDs like a traditional B-tree index, 
it stores bitmaps for each distinct value, 
reducing storage space and improving performance in certain queries.

Columns with low cardinality (e.g., gender, marital status, department).

== how to find second highest salary

select max(sal) secondmaxsal from emp where sal < (select max(sal) from emp);
